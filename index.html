        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        I'm a senior at Duke University studying mathematics and statistics. I am interested in a broad array of statistical topics, including statistical genetics, missing data, survey statistics, differential privacy and applications to the biomedical and social sciences. On the more mathematical side, I have a growing interest in high-dimensional probability and related topics (concentration, random matrices, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>At Duke, I am currently working with Profs. Jerry Reiter, Jichun Xie and Nicholas Cook. I also work in <a href="http://chiragjpgroup.org" target = "_blank">Prof. Chirag Patel's group</a> at Harvard Medical School.</p>
        <p>
        Outside of research, I have a strong interest in journalism. I served as news editor for The Chronicle, Duke's independent newspaper, and have a particular interest in covering administrative actions and their associated impact on students and other members of the Duke community.</p> 

        <p>I am an avid basketball fan and work on the creative team for Duke Men’s Basketball.</p>
