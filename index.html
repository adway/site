        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        I'm a senior at Duke University studying mathematics and statistics. I am interested in a broad array of statistical topics, including statistical genetics, missing data, survey statistics, differential privacy and applications to the biomedical and social sciences. On the more mathematical side, I have a growing interest in high-dimensional probability and algebraic and geometric statistics.
        </p>
        <p>At Duke, I am very fortunate to work with Prof. Jerry Reiter, Prof. Jichun Xie and Prof. Ezra Miller. I also work with Prof. Chirag Patel at Harvard Medical School.
        <p>
        Outside of research, I have a strong interest in journalism and worked as a news reporter and editor for The Chronicle, Duke's student-run newspaper.</p> 

        <p>I am an avid basketball fan and work on the creative team for Duke Men’s Basketball.</p>
